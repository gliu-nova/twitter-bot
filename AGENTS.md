# AGENTS.md - Grok Build Instructions

## Project Overview
Python bot that ingests market/macro indicators (Yahoo, FRED, CoinGecko), stores readings in SQLite, and posts X/Twitter alerts when configurable thresholds are crossed. Config: `config.yaml`. Entry point: `run.py`.

## X/Twitter Post Format (`src/posting/compose.py`)
Posts must be scannable, not text blobs. Max ~280 characters. Tone: professional, data-driven.

**Structure** (blank line between sections):
1. Headline (indicator name; `MAJOR MOVE:` prefix only for exceptional events)
2. Data — values and % changes on separate lines when useful
3. Context — one short line (rarity, level break, historic spike)
4. Takeaway — `→` prefix, one concise line

**Emojis:** Max 1 per post (`🚨` `⚠️` `📈` `📉`). Use only for exceptional moves (emergency tier, ATH, standalone major liquidations, key macro breaks). Most posts have **no** emoji.

**Style:** Succinct. Avoid editorializing. Numbers lead; context follows.

## Core Coding Principles

### 1. Think Before Coding
Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.  
Before implementing:

* State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
* If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
* If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
* If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

* No features beyond what was asked.
* No abstractions for single-use code.
* No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
* No error handling for impossible scenarios.
* If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:
* Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
* Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
* Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
* If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
* Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
* Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

**Test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
* "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
* "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

[Step] → verify: [check]
[Step] → verify: [check]
[Step] → verify: [check]

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

text## Output Style & Readability
- Prioritize **readability and maintainability**.
- Use clear variable/function names.
- Add minimal but helpful comments only where logic is non-obvious.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Prefer modern, clean C++ / Python idioms.

## Final Response Marker
**Every time you have fully completed the entire user request, end your final response with exactly:**
